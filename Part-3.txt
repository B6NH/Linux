Part 3 - Common Tasks and Essential Tools

------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 14 - Package Management

'yum search emacs' - package search
'apt-get install emacs' - package installation
'rpm -i emacs-22.1-7.fc7-i386.rpm' - installation from file
'apt-get remove emacs' - package removal
'apt-get update; apt-get upgrade' - update packages
'rpm -U emacs-22.1-7.fc7-i386.rpm' - update package from file
'dpkg -l' - display installed packages
'dpkg --status emacs' - display package status
'dpkg -S emacs' - search for filename from installed packages

The most popular packaging systems are deb and rpm.
Majority of Linux software can be found on the Internet.
Packages are usually created by distribution vendors.
Device drivers are part of Linux kernel.

------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 15 - Storage Media

mount - list currently mounted file systems
umount - unmount file system
'tail -f /var/log/syslog' - observe syslog file in real time
'fdisk /dev/sdb' - configure disk partitions
'mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdb1' - create filesystem on partition sdb1
fsck - check and repair filesystem
'dd if=/dev/sdb of=/dev/sdc' - copy data from one device to another
'dd if=/dev/sdb of=flash_drive.img' - copy data to file
'genisoimage -o cd-rom.iso -R -J ~/cd-rom-files' - create ISO image
'mount -o loop image.iso /mnt/iso_image' - mount image

File '/etc/fstab' contains list of devices that are mounted at boot time.
Name of disk can be read from file '/var/log/syslog'.
Command dd works only for disks with filesystems.
Integrity of ISO image can be verified with md5sum command.
Programs cdrdao and wodim can be used to write data to CDs and DVDs.

------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 16 - Networking

ping - send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST
traceroute - print packet route
ip - network configuration tool
netstat - examine network settings and statistics
ftp - internet file transfer
'get ubuntu-18.04-desktop-amd64.iso' - transfer file to local system(ftp session)
'wget http://linuxcommand.org/index.php' - download page

Some FTP servers require password in for of email address.
On most anonymous FTP servers files for public downloading are found in 'pub' directory.
Program ssh is used to log into remote machines.
Using ssh, it is possible to execute commands and run GUI programs.
Commands scp and sftp allow files to be copied through ssh-encrypted tunnel.

------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 17 - Searching for Files

locate/mlocate - find file by name
find - find file in directory
'find ~' - list all files in home directory
'find ~ -type d | wc -l' - display number of directories in home directory
'find ~ -type f -name "*.JPG" -size +1M | wc -l' - find .jpg files larger than 1 mb
'find ~ -type f -name '*.bak' -delete' - delete files with .bak extension
'find ~ -iname '*.jpg' -print0 | xargs --null ls -l' - xargs with null as separator
stat - display file status

Command 'find' can perform various tests on files.
Individual conditions can be combined with logical operators.
User-defined actions are called by applying -exec and -ok commands.
To combine arguments, one can use find with '+' option or function xargs.

------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 18 - Archiving and Backup

gzip - compress and replace file
gunzip - restore compressed file to its original form
'zcat/gunzip -c' - view contents of compressed file
'tar cf playground.tar playground' - create archive
'tar xf ../playground.tar' - extract archive
zip - package and compress archive files
unzip - extract zip archive
'rsync -av playground foo' - synchronize directories
'rsync source/ destination' - copy only contents of source directory

There are 2 types of compression algorithms: lossy and lossless.
Higher compression levels can be achieved with bzip2.
Program rsync is used to synchronize directories.

------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 19 - Regular Expressions

grep - global regular expression print
. - match 1 character
^ $ - beginning and end anchors
[tc] - set of characters
[^km] - negation
[:graph:] - character class
'AAA | BBB' - alternation
Quantifier matching:
  ? - 1 or 0 elements
  * - 0 or more elements
  + - at least 1 element
  {5} - 5 elements

Regular expressions are used to identify patterns in text.
Metacharacters specify complex patterns.
Types of regular expressions:
  - basic regular expressions (BRE)
  - extended regular expressions (ERE)

------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 20 - Text Processing

'cat -A foo.txt' - display non-printing characters
sort - sort lines of text files
'ls -l /usr/bin | sort -nrk 5 | head' - reverse numerical sort with 5th field key
uniq - omit repeated lines in sorted file
'cut -f 3 distros.txt' - extract 3rd tab-separated field
paste - add columns of text to file
join - join sorted files with common fields
comm - simple file comparison
diff - advanced file comparison
patch - modify file with diff output
tr - transliterate characters
'echo "front" | sed '1s/front/back/'' - replace 'front' with 'back' in first line
aspell - spell check

The sed program edits streams of text.
Back references are commands that use results of previous matches.
For more complicated tasks, it is possible to create sed scripts.

------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 21 - Formatting Output

'nl distros.txt' - display file with line numbers
'echo "The quick brown fox jumped over" | fold -w 12' - set line width
'fmt -w 50 -p '# ' fmt-code.txt' - format lines starting with '# '
'pr -l 15 -w 65 distros.txt' - paginate text
printf - format and print data

There are many simple command line tools for formatting text.
Programs that convert files are usually named using 'format2format' convention.
Two advanced text formatting tools are TEX and groff.
