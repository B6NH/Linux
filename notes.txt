This results in long format output sorted by file modification date in reverse order.
There are also other options available for ls command.

Double click on file to copy its name.

The Linux operating system contains many typical directories.
Symbolic links allow to have a file referenced by multiple names.

Chapter 4

cp - copy files/directories
mv - move and rename files/directories
mkdir - create directory
rm - remove files/directories
ln - create links(hard/symbolic)

Wildcards allow to select filenames based on patterns.
Hard link is indistinguishable from the file itself.
File is deleted when all hard links are deleted.
If file referred to by the symbolic link is deleted, link will be broken.
Use ls with -i option to display inode number.
Hard links can only be used with files.
Use ln with -s option to create symbolic link.
Leading l indicates symbolic link.
Path to file is relative to path of symbolic link.
